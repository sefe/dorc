# Server and Database Connectivity Monitoring

## Overview

DOrc now includes a system to periodically monitor the connectivity status of all registered servers and databases. This helps identify infrastructure issues proactively and provides visibility into which resources are currently reachable.

## Features

### Background Monitoring Service
- Automatically checks connectivity to all servers and databases at configurable intervals
- Runs as a hosted service within the Dorc.Monitor application
- **Uses batch processing** to efficiently handle large numbers of servers and databases (100 per batch)
- Updates status information in the database for each check
- Logs progress and warnings when resources become unreachable

### Server Connectivity Check
- Uses ICMP ping to verify server reachability
- 5-second timeout per check
- Verifies basic network connectivity to the server

### Database Connectivity Check  
- Attempts to establish a SQL Server connection
- 5-second timeout per connection attempt
- Uses integrated security (Windows Authentication)
- Verifies both network connectivity and SQL Server availability

### Web UI Indicators

The Status column in both the Servers and Databases list views displays:

- ✅ **Green check + "Online"**: Resource is currently reachable
  - Tooltip shows: "Last checked: [timestamp]"

- ❌ **Red X + "Offline"**: Resource was unreachable in the last check
  - Tooltip shows: "Last checked: [timestamp]"

- ⚠️ **Orange warning + "Unreachable (7+ days)"**: Resource has been unreachable for 7 or more days
  - Tooltip shows: "Not reachable since: [timestamp]"
  - This indicates the resource may need attention or may have been decommissioned

- ⚪ **Gray "Not checked"**: Connectivity has not been checked yet
  - Appears for newly added resources before the first check cycle

## Configuration

### Enabling Connectivity Checks

The connectivity check service is **disabled by default** to avoid performance issues when multiple Monitor instances are running. To enable it, configure the `appsettings.json` file:

**File**: `src/Dorc.Monitor/appsettings.json`
```json
{
  "AppSettings": {
    "EnableConnectivityCheck": "True",
    "ConnectivityCheckIntervalMinutes": "60"
  }
}
```

**Important**: Only enable this on **one** Monitor instance (typically the Production Monitor) to avoid:
- Multiple instances checking the same resources simultaneously
- Database contention when updating connectivity status
- Unnecessary network traffic

### Check Frequency

The connectivity check interval can be configured in `appsettings.json`:

**Default**: 60 minutes (1 hour)

To modify, change the `ConnectivityCheckIntervalMinutes` setting:
```json
"ConnectivityCheckIntervalMinutes": "30"  // Check every 30 minutes
```

**Initial Delay**: The service waits 2 minutes after starting before performing the first check to allow the Monitor service to fully initialize.

**Batch Processing**: The service processes servers and databases in batches of 100 to avoid loading large datasets into memory. This ensures efficient operation even with thousands of resources.

### Unreachable Threshold
The threshold for showing the orange warning is 7 days. This can be modified in the UI renderers:

**Files**: 
- `src/dorc-web/src/pages/page-servers-list.ts`
- `src/dorc-web/src/pages/page-databases-list.ts`

```typescript
const oneWeekAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

## Database Schema Changes

The connectivity status columns are included in the CREATE TABLE scripts for SERVER and DATABASE tables. When deploying the database project, these columns will be automatically added to new databases.

### SERVER Table
- `LastChecked` (DATETIME2, nullable): Timestamp of the last connectivity check
- `IsReachable` (BIT, nullable): Boolean indicating if the server was reachable

### DATABASE Table
- `LastChecked` (DATETIME2, nullable): Timestamp of the last connectivity check
- `IsReachable` (BIT, nullable): Boolean indicating if the database was reachable

**Note**: For existing databases, these columns will be added automatically during the next database deployment.

## Logging

The connectivity service logs:
- Info messages when starting/stopping and configuration status
- Info messages when starting each check cycle
- Info messages after completing each check cycle with counts
- Warning messages for individual unreachable resources
- Error messages for unexpected failures during checks

**Log Location**: Check the Dorc.Monitor application logs

**Example Log Messages**:
```
INFO  - Connectivity Check Service is starting. Check interval: 60 minutes.
INFO  - Waiting 2 minutes before first connectivity check...
INFO  - Starting connectivity check cycle...
INFO  - Starting server connectivity check for 42 servers in batches of 100...
INFO  - Processed 42/42 servers...
INFO  - Completed connectivity check for 42 servers.
INFO  - Starting database connectivity check for 18 databases in batches of 100...
WARN  - Database AppDB on PROD-SQL-01 (ID: 456) is not reachable.
INFO  - Processed 18/18 databases...
INFO  - Completed connectivity check for 18 databases.
INFO  - Connectivity check cycle completed.
```

**Disabled Service**:
```
INFO  - Connectivity Check Service is disabled in configuration.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Service Not Starting
- Check if `EnableConnectivityCheck` is set to `"true"` (lowercase) in `appsettings.json`
- The setting is **case-sensitive** - use `"true"` or `"True"`, not `"TRUE"`
- Review logs for the message: "Connectivity Check Service is disabled in configuration."
- Verify the Monitor service has the necessary configuration settings
- Check that the service waits 2 minutes before the first check (initial delay is intentional)
- If you see "Connectivity Check Service was cancelled during initial delay", the service is stopping before initialization completes - check for service restart issues

### Servers Always Showing as Offline
- Verify the Dorc.Monitor service has network access to ping the servers
- Check if ICMP (ping) is blocked by firewalls
- Ensure server names are correct and resolve via DNS

### Databases Always Showing as Offline
- Verify the Dorc.Monitor service account has SQL Server login permissions
- Check if SQL Server is running and accepting connections
- Ensure Windows Authentication is configured correctly
- Verify firewall rules allow SQL Server connections (default port 1433)

### Checks Not Running
- Verify the Dorc.Monitor service is running
- Check the Monitor service logs for errors
- Ensure `EnableConnectivityCheck` is set to `"True"` in appsettings.json
- Verify only ONE Monitor instance has connectivity checking enabled
- Look for the initial 2-minute delay message in logs

### Status Not Updating in UI
- Refresh the browser page
- Verify the Dorc.Api is serving the updated status fields
- Check browser console for API errors
- Wait for the next check cycle (default: 60 minutes after service start)

### Multiple Monitor Instances Conflict
- Only enable connectivity checking on ONE Monitor instance (typically Production)
- Set `EnableConnectivityCheck` to `"False"` on all other instances
- This prevents database contention and duplicate checks

## Security Considerations

- Server checks use ICMP ping only - no credentials required
- Database checks use integrated security (Windows Authentication)
- No passwords or credentials are stored or logged
- Connection failures are handled gracefully without exposing sensitive details
- The service runs with the same permissions as the Dorc.Monitor application

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Configurable check intervals per resource
- Email/webhook notifications for resources that become unreachable
- Historical connectivity reporting and trends
- Support for alternative authentication methods for databases
- Customizable timeout values per resource type
- Dashboard view showing overall infrastructure health
