## 1. Purpose

This is the deliverable of IS step **S-005** and the resolution of **U-1/U-5**'s SF-3 branch:
a categorised, in-repo record of every Aikido finding, with an **in-context exploitability
assessment** (not a restatement of the scanner) and a remediation recommendation. From this
record, S-006 fix steps are scoped.

**Headline:** issue #605 framed the problem as "CLI tools and PowerShell module." The actual
Aikido surface is broader, and the **two most genuinely exploitable findings are outside that
framing** — an unescaped LDAP filter in `Dorc.Core` and an AD-display-name `innerHTML` sink in
`dorc-web`. The bulk of the "critical" path-traversal hits, by contrast, are on
operator-supplied or internally-generated (same-trust) inputs and rate lower in real-world risk
than their scanner score suggests. The plan's scope and the S-006 ordering should reflect this.

This document does not include exploit detail beyond what is needed to scope and verify fixes
(HLPS C-06).

## 3. Detail and rationale

### T-1 — LDAP query injection (TRUE POSITIVE, HIGH) — *outside #605 scope*
`GetSidsForUser` builds `ds.Filter = $"(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName={name}))"` with the
account name interpolated directly into the LDAP filter, unescaped. This is a textbook LDAP
filter injection (CWE-90). Exploitability hinges on whether `samAccountName` can carry filter
metacharacters from a caller-influenced path; even constrained, injecting `*` or boolean
clauses can alter which account/SIDs are resolved — a security-relevant outcome since SIDs drive
authorization. This is the single highest-scored finding and the most clearly worth fixing.
**Recommendation:** escape the value with the standard LDAP filter-escaping routine, or bind it
via a parameterised search. Add a unit test asserting metacharacters are neutralised.

### T-2 — XSS via AD-display-name `innerHTML` (TRUE POSITIVE, MED–HIGH) — *outside #605 scope*
`renderSearchResults` sets `root.innerHTML` by string-concatenating `searchResult.DisplayName`
and `searchResult.FullLogonName` from directory search results. AD object display names are not
guaranteed HTML-safe; a crafted directory object renders into the combo-box dropdown as live
markup (stored/reflected XSS, CWE-79). **Recommendation:** render via `textContent` / Lit
templated nodes rather than `innerHTML` string building, or HTML-escape the interpolated fields.

### T-3 — `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` CVE (TRUE POSITIVE, HIGH, easy)
Two HIGH CVEs fixed in 8.0.3; project pins 8.0.2. **Recommendation:** bump the package
reference in `Dorc.PowerShell.csproj` to ≥8.0.3. No code change expected.

### T-4 — Unpinned GitHub Action (TRUE POSITIVE, MED, easy)
`release.yml:214` references a third-party action by a mutable tag. Supply-chain exposure
(CWE-829). **Recommendation:** pin to a full commit SHA (and optionally add a comment with the
human-readable version). Audit the rest of both workflow files for the same pattern while there.

### T-5 — Other web `innerHTML` sinks (TRUE POSITIVE pattern, LOW–MED)
Several Lit grid/column renderers assign `root.innerHTML = \`...${value}...\``. Most interpolate
controlled/enum values (e.g. `page-project-bundles.ts:374` interpolates the bundle `Type` enum
string), so live exploitability is low, but the pattern is fragile and each site should be
assessed for whether any user/DB-controlled string can reach it. **Recommendation:** standardise
on safe rendering (`textContent` / templated nodes); fix any site where free-text or
directory/user data flows in (treat those as T-2-class). Good candidate to pair with the
frontend-test bootstrap (issue #595).

### T-6 / T-7 — Path traversal in file readers/writers and Terraform code sources (TRUE POSITIVE, defence-in-depth, LOW / LOW–MED)
The script-group pipe files (T-6) derive a path from `pipeName`, which is an internally-generated
identifier passed Monitor→Runner on the same host within the same trust domain — not an
anonymous-attacker input. The Terraform code-source providers (T-7) copy from
`scriptGroup.ScriptsLocation`, an **admin-configured** component path, and build destinations via
`Path.Combine(destDir, relativePath)` (zip-slip-style risk on copy). These are real CWE-22
patterns but the inputs are privileged/internal, so they are defence-in-depth rather than open
remote vulnerabilities. **Recommendation:** add path-containment validation — canonicalise with
`Path.GetFullPath` and assert the result stays under the intended root before opening/copying;
validate `pipeName` matches the expected GUID shape. Batch these as one hardening change.

### T-8 — CLI file-path argument (FALSE POSITIVE / ACCEPTED, LOW)
`Tools.PropertyValueCreationCLI` reads a file path supplied as a command-line argument by the
operator running the tool. An operator choosing which local file to read is expected behaviour,
not a traversal attack — the operator already holds the tool's privileges. (Line 94 is an
exception-message interpolation, not a file operation at all — a scanner mis-attribution.)
**Recommendation:** mark accepted-risk with justification; no code change. Optionally validate
the path exists / has the expected extension for UX.

### T-9 / T-10 — `Microsoft.Identity.Client` and `System.Text.Json` CVEs (TRUE POSITIVE, LOW, easy)
Transitive/direct dependency CVEs with available patched versions. **Recommendation:** bump
`Microsoft.Identity.Client` to ≥4.81.0 across the five projects and `System.Text.Json` to the
patched 8.x in `Tools.DeployCopyEnvBuildCLI`. Verify no breaking API changes; these are minor
bumps.

### T-11 — Leaked secret in OAuth doc (FALSE POSITIVE, LOW)
`OAUTH_400_ERROR_DIAGNOSIS.md:194` is a **truncated, illustrative** JWT
(`"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc..."`) in a sample response block — not a live credential.
**Recommendation:** no secret rotation needed; the alert is cleared for free by **S-002**, which
already relocates/removes this root-level document. Good intersection — fold the verification
into S-002.

### T-12 — vite.config file inclusion (FALSE POSITIVE / ACCEPTED, LOW)
Flagged file reads occur in the Vite build configuration (build-time, developer-controlled),
not in a runtime request path. **Recommendation:** mark accepted-risk; no change.

## 4. Recommended remediation grouping (feeds S-006)

| Sub-step | Scope | Findings | Effort | Priority |
|----------|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| S-006a | Dependency bumps (Xml, Identity.Client, Text.Json) | T-3, T-9, T-10 | XS | **DONE** (build-verified) |
| S-006b | Pin GitHub Actions to SHA + sweep both workflows | T-4 | XS | **DONE** (EnricoMi → v2.23.0 SHA) |
| S-006c | LDAP filter escaping + test | T-1 | S | **DONE** (7/7 tests) |
| S-006d | Safe rendering for directory/user data sinks; assess all `innerHTML` sites | T-2, T-5 | S–M | **DONE (partial)** — T-2 + directory `DisplayName` T-5 sinks fixed (tests pass); identifier/enum T-5 sites deferred |
| S-006e | Path-containment hardening for file readers/copiers + pipe-name validation | T-6, T-7 | M | **DONE** — `PathContainment` guard on pipe-file + copy sites (6/6 tests); `TerraformProcessor` caller-path + already-safe `ZipFile.ExtractToDirectory` deferred/excluded |
| S-006f | Accept-with-justification records | T-8, T-11, T-12 | XS | Doc only (T-11 closed by S-002) — pending |

S-006a/S-006b are zero-code-risk quick wins that clear the largest count of open alerts and
should land first. S-006c is the highest-value code fix. S-006e is a single batched hardening
change rather than per-file edits.

### S-006a delivery note (build-verified on .NET 8 / Linux)

- **T-3 (HIGH) fixed:** pinned transitive `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` to **8.0.3** in
  `Dorc.PowerShell` — resolves 8.0.3, project builds clean.
- **T-9 fixed for first-party projects:** bumped the direct `Microsoft.Identity.Client` ref in
  `Dorc.PersistentData` **4.78.0 → 4.81.0**; verified this propagates **4.81.0** to `Dorc.Api`
  and `Dorc.Core` through the project graph (no separate pins needed there).
- **T-10 needs no change:** the flagged project (`Tools.DeployCopyEnvBuildCLI`) already resolves
  `System.Text.Json` **9.0.10** (≫ patched 8.0.5) via EF Core / `Dorc.ApiModel`; an explicit
  8.0.5 pin is an **NU1605 downgrade** and was reverted. The finding's "8.0.0" reflects a
  different (older) restore; the current graph is not vulnerable.
- **Deferred (low severity):** `Microsoft.Identity.Client` alerts on `Org.OpenAPITools` (a
  generated Azure DevOps client — a pin would be overwritten on regeneration) and
  `Tests.Acceptance` (4.73.1, test-only). Bump those directly if the team wants the alerts zeroed.
- **Regression check:** `Dorc.Core.Tests` 127/127 pass after the bumps. (`Dorc.Api.Tests` has 22
  pre-existing failures unrelated to this work — `WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent()` /
  `PlatformNotSupportedException` on Linux; they pass on the Windows CI.)

## 5. Plan amendments this triage implies

1. **U-5 resolved** — finding list obtained and assessed (this document).
2. **SF-3 scope was too narrow.** The HLPS SF-3 description ("CLI tools and PowerShell module")
   undercounts the surface; the highest-risk findings (T-1 in `Dorc.Core`, T-2 in `dorc-web`)
   are elsewhere. SF-3 should be restated as "the Aikido SAST/SCA surface," and the IS S-006
   replaced by the S-006a–f grouping above.
3. **T-11 intersects S-002** — relocating/removing `OAUTH_400_ERROR_DIAGNOSIS.md` also clears
   the leaked-secret alert; note this in S-002's verification intent.
4. **No blocking unknowns remain for SF-3.** S-006a/b/c are ready to scope into JIT Specs once
   the plan is approved.
